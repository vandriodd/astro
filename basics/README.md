# Astro Basics ü™ê

This README ccontains theoretical notes and key concepts to understand Astro.

> [!WARNING]
> Maybe some of the concepts are not 100% accurate because I'm just starting to learn Astro. If you find any mistakes, please let me know!

## Island Architecture üèù

**Island Architecture** is a frontend design pattern where static pages contain "islands" of interactivity. These islands are reactive components that load JavaScript only when necessary, enhancing performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript loaded by default.

### Why Does It Matter?

- **Performance**: by not loading JavaScript on the client by default, pages load faster, improving user experience.
- **SEO**: static content is easily indexable by search engines, ensuring better SEO performance.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Astro allows you to use multiple UI libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, or Angular in the same project, providing flexibility in choosing the best rools for you needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to install the Astro VSCode extension, as Astro uses its own syntax, which is similar to JSX, but it's not the same.

## Astro Syntax ‚úçüèª

Astro files typically include the following sections:

### Script Block (`---`)

The section between the `---` is where you can write JavaScript, including imports, data fetching, and defining props.

```astro
---
import SomeComponent from '../components/SomeComponent.astro'
const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
---
```

### Template Block

Below the script block is the template section, which defines the rendered content. This may look like a React component, but it's not.

```astro
<SomeComponent data={data} />
```

### Style Block

At the bottom of the file, you can include styles within a `<style>` tag.

```astro
<style>
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

**Scoped styles**: styles in Astro are scoped to the specific component, similar to Vue or Svelte. This means they only apply to the elements withing the component where they are defined.

## Layouts and Components üß©

- **Layouts**: Astro allows you to create reusable layouts that can be applied across different pages.
- **Components**: Astro minimizes boilerplate, enabling you to write less code while achieving the same functionality. Unlike other frameworks, you won't see and explicit "export" in components.

When you navigate to a page in your Astro project, the file served is typically `index.astro` located in the `/pages` directory.

## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```plaintext
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.svg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Card.astro
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Layout.astro
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.astro
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Astro looks for .astro or .md files in the src/pages/ directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about src/components/, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/ directory.

## Available Commands üõ†Ô∏è

Here are the key commands you can run with pnpm:

- `pnpm run dev`: Starts the Astro development server (`astro dev`).
- `pnpm run build`: Builds the project for production (`astro build`).
- `pnpm run preview`: Previews the built project (`astro preview`).
- `pnpm run astro`: Executes generic Astro commands.

> [!NOTE]
> Fun fact! Astro uses port 4321 for its dev server, like a countdown to a rocket launch!

## Fast Refresh and HMR üîÑ

Astro comes with features like fast refresh and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing you to see changes immediately after saving your files.

### Build Process üöß

When you run pnpm run build, Astro doesn‚Äôt generate any JavaScript files by default. This reinforces Astro‚Äôs core idea: only load JavaScript when absolutely necessary.

**CSS Scoping**: Astro automatically creates a hash for the HTML elements based on the styles declared in your files. For example, if you style a `<main>` element within a component, Astro will ensure that style applies only to that specific `<main>` element, using a unique data attribute like `main[data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6]`.

## TailwindCSS Integration with Astro

Astro provides a seamless integration system where adding tools like tailwind is a simple as running a single command.

To explore all available integrations, you can use the following:

```bash
pnpm astro add --help
```

For example, to add TailwindCSS to your Astro project, you can run:

```bash
pnpm astro add tailwind
```

## Routing in Astro üö¶

Astro features a built-in routing system that works similarly to other frameworks.To create a new page, simply create a `.astro` file in the `pages` directory, and you can navigate to it by using the corresponding URL.

## Slots in Astro üéõÔ∏è

In a layout component like `Layout.astro`, you can use the `<slot />` element, which works similarly to `children` in React.

```astro
<slot />
```

### Named slots

Slots in Astro are a powerful feature that allows you to insert content into specific parts of a component. For example, if you want to add an icon to a button, either to the left or right, you can use named slots:

```astro
<slot name="before" /> <!-- This slot is placed BEFORE the button's text -->
```

You can then use this slot in another component:

```astro
<svg (...) slot="before"></svg> <!-- The SVG will appear BEFORE the text -->
```

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is similar to slots in Vue.js.

Layouts allow you to apply consistent styles and structure across all the content wrapped with the layout.

### Default Slot Content

If a slot does not receive any content, you can specify default content like this:

```astro
<slot>Default content</slot>
```

> [!INFO]
> This is a CSS Tip!
> Using the CSS property `color-scheme: dark light;` specifies that your site should default to dark mode, and all colors should adapt accordingly. For instance, text will be white without needing to explicitly set `color: #ffffff` or `text-white`.

## Markdown (.md) Support üìù

Astro fully supports Markdown files (`.md`). If you create a Markdown file in the `pages` directory, it will be accessible as a route, complete with default styles and formatting.

### Front Matter in Markdown

In Markdown, "Front Matter" refers to metadata at the top of a file enclosed in `---`. It is used to define variables that can be accessed within the Markdown file, such as the title, date, or layout.

```markdown
---
title: "My Markdown Page"
date: "2022-01-01"
layout: "Layout.astro"
---
```

## Content Collections üìö

Astro also supports a feature called Content Collections, which allows you to organize and manage your content more efficiently. This is an advanced feature worth exploring as you continue your Astro journey.

Additionally, you can create `.html` files in the `pages` directory, and they will be treated as routes just like `.astro` and `.md` files.
